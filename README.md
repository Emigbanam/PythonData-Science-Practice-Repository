# Data Science Practice Repository

## Overview
This repository serves as my personal **data science learning lab**, containing hands-on practice exercises and projects as I develop my skills in data analysis, visualization, and machine learning. Each exercise focuses on building practical experience with real-world datasets and common data science workflows.

### Learning Focus Areas:
- Data manipulation and cleaning with `pandas`
- Statistical analysis and hypothesis testing
- Data visualization using `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `plotly`
- Feature engineering and preprocessing
- Basic machine learning techniques

This repository is **actively maintained** and grows weekly with new practice exercises, coding challenges, and mini-projects.

## Repository Structure
Each practice exercise is contained in its own Jupyter Notebook with accompanying datasets (when possible). The current structure includes:

### Exploratory Data Analysis Practice
- `Online Retail Store.ipynb`: Customer behavior analysis and sales patterns
- `Online Retail.csv` (dataset not included): E-commerce transaction data
- `Netflix Test.ipynb`: Content analysis and viewing trends exploration  
- `netflix_data.csv` (dataset not included): Streaming platform dataset

### Practice Exercises
- `Cars DEDA.ipynb`: **[Weekly Updates]** Automotive data analysis - exploring pricing, features, and market trends
- `nobel prize winners data.ipynb`:  Historical analysis of Nobel laureates and award patterns
- `crimes.ipynb`:  Crime statistics analysis and geographic patterns
- `NYC School Test Scores.ipnyb`:  Analysis of test scores of schools in a geaography
- `Practicing Functions.ipnyb`
- `Hypothesis Testing Practice.pnyb`

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Install the required Python libraries:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly scikit-learn jupyter
```

### Running the Practice Exercises
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Emigbanam/data-science-practice.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd data-science-practice
   ```
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Open any notebook and run the cells to see the analysis in action.

## Learning Progress & Updates
- **New exercises added weekly** covering different aspects of data science
- **Existing notebooks updated regularly** with improved techniques and additional insights
- **Progressive skill building** from basic EDA to more advanced analytics
- **Documentation of learning journey** with comments explaining thought processes

## Skills Being Developed
- **Data Wrangling**: Cleaning messy datasets, handling missing values, data type conversions
- **Statistical Analysis**: Descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, hypothesis testing
- **Visualization**: Creating compelling charts and interactive dashboards
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying trends, outliers, and meaningful relationships in data
- **Communication**: Presenting findings clearly through code comments and markdown documentation

## Future Learning Goals
- Advanced machine learning algorithms
- Time series analysis and forecasting
- A/B testing and experimental design
- Big data tools (Spark, Hadoop)
- Cloud-based analytics platforms

## Notes
- Datasets are sourced from public repositories, Kaggle, and educational platforms
- Code includes extensive comments for learning purposes
- Each exercise builds upon previous concepts while introducing new techniques
- Feedback and suggestions for improvement are always welcome!
